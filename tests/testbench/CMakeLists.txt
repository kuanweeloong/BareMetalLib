# beacuse of cases such as:
#   - Building on an x86 OS running on an x86_64 processor.
#   - CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR or the architecture itself being a bit finicky with names (e.g. x86
#     having different revisions such as i386, i486 etc).
# If BML_TESTBENCH_ARCH is not explicitly defined, it defaults to CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR.
